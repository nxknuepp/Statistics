%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Unit 2 Project %%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Instructions:} In your group, choose one of the four options described below. Analyze the data using what you have learned in Unit 2. Each group will make a poster and present their analysis in a gallery walk. Based on feedback from the gallery walk, each group will revise their work and present an improved analysis to the class. Your instructor may also require each group member to write an analysis and submit it individually. \\


\textbf{Poster Instructions:} Your poster will include the following: 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{.5pt}
\item A statement of the research question 
\item A description of the source of the data 
\item A description of the variables used in the analysis and an explanation of why your group chose these variables
\item Graphs (with clear labels) and numerical summaries to support your analysis
\item Explanations that reflect the use of Unit 2 concepts
\item An answer to the question based on your analysis of the data
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Option 1: Movies}

\textbf{Research question for Option 1:} Which genres of movies are more successful: Action/Adventure movies or other types of movies? 

Answer this question using the data set \emph{Movies.txt}. Choose at least one quantitative variable that relates to your definition of success. Compare the success of action/adventure movies to other movies using the variable(s) you chose. Follow the instructions for the poster above.

\textbf{Option 2: Body Temperatures}\\

In current medical practice, 98.6°F is considered a normal body temperature, but this is an average.  Normal body temperatures will vary throughout the day and are sensitive to hormone levels. However, an abnormally high or an abnormally low temperature may be a sign of illness. 


\textbf{Research question for Option 2:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{.5pt}
\item According to this data, what is a normal range for adult body temperature? What temperatures would you label as abnormally high or abnormally low? 
\item Should there be different normal temperature benchmarks for men and women?
\end{itemize} 

To answer these questions analyze the adult body temperature data in \emph{Body Temperature and Heart Rate.txt}. Follow the instructions for the poster above.

\bigskip 
\textbf{Option 3: Breakfast Cereals}\\

\textbf{Research question for Option 3:} Are cereals targeted at children less healthy than cereals targeted at adults?

Answer this question using the data set \emph{Cereals.txt}. Choose at least one quantitative variable that relates to your definition of healthy or unhealthy. Compare adult and child cereals using the variable(s) you chose. Follow the instructions for the poster above.
\newpage
\textbf{Option 4: Unisex Belt}\\

Suppose that you are designing a one-size-fits-most unisex belt for adults. The belt should be long enough to fit typical adults without having an excessive amount of extra length. 

\textbf{Research questions for Option 4:}
\begin{itemize} 
\setlength\itemsep{.5pt}
\item What is the length of your belt? Where along the length of the belt are the holes and why?
\item Based on this data, approximately what proportion of adults will be able to wear your belt?
\end{itemize}

Answer these questions using the data set \emph{Body Measurement.txt}. Choose at least one quantitative variable that is relevant to the design of your belt. Follow the instructions for the poster above.
